# Creative Project 2: Voice and Audio

by Mark Bennett

This work uses p5js, rita and p5js speech to create a voice synthesizer from a Markovy geneated text. The books chosen are Alice and Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast. It selects random lines from each text and combines them. On a canvas click you are shown and read these lines

##Instructions for running the project
The project can [ viewed here](https://editor.p5js.org/TheMarkBennett/sketches/DdoEMYzx0). Using the ps5js editor you need to add the dom addon libary and the p5js speech libary. The rita library is used to combine the text.

## Artist Statement

The work uses Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast to geneate new text using the rita libray.
This [Text generation](https://editor.p5js.org/TheMarkBennett/sketches/DdoEMYzx0) example was used to combine the two text. [p5 speech example](https://editor.p5js.org/piecesofuk/sketches/SyBpNOJTb) by piecesofuk and [FINAL_WORKING_tts.voice](https://editor.p5js.org/carrefinho/sketches/Bk_SrRlJE) by carrefinho to get text to speech working. These works help me get a better understanding of the power of ps5js.
