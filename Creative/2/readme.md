# Creative Project 2: Voice and Audio
by Mark Bennett

This work uses p5js, tracery and p5js speech to create a voice synthesizer. By clicking on the canvas the user is read a tweet randomly generated using tracery. With each click a voice synthesizer is chosen at random. The base text used is from a couples tweet.

## Instructions for running the project
The project can [ viewed here](https://editor.p5js.org/TheMarkBennett/present/1Ygb1Ygm-). Using the ps5js editor you need to add the dom addon libary and the p5js speech libary.

## Artist Statement
The text in this work is based of a couple tweet by [@sixfootcandy](https://twitter.com/sixfootcandy/status/1346531834696384514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1346531834696384514%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fpetty-things-couples-do-mad-tweets_l_60622e7cc5b65d1c28182a24).
[tracery example](https://editor.p5js.org/allison.parrish/sketches/ByfvClyTg) by allison.parrish was used to install and setup tracery. [p5 speech example](https://editor.p5js.org/piecesofuk/sketches/SyBpNOJTb) by piecesofuk and [FINAL_WORKING_tts.voice](https://editor.p5js.org/carrefinho/sketches/Bk_SrRlJE) by carrefinho to get text to speech working. These works help me get a better understanding of the power of ps5js.
