# Creative Project 1

This project creates a new speech from president Barack Obama previous speeches. 

## Web Scraping

The speeches were scraped from an archive site [Obama Speeches](http://obamaspeeches.com/). [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) was used to scrape all the links of the website. Beautiful Soup is also used to loop through all the links and grabs the content from those pages.

## GPT2
GPT2 was used to create new speeches using Obama previous speeches.


## Improvements need
The website with the speech is older making it harder to get that content. I also go titles and some content that was not needed. 

The content has a wonky format that I could not fix. Fixing this would help with sentence structure and give it a more natural look.
