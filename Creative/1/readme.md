# Creative Project 1

This project creates a new speech from president Barack Obama previous speeches. 

## Web Scraping

The speeches were scraped from an archive site [Obama Speeches](http://obamaspeeches.com/). [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) was used to scrape all the links of the website. Beautiful Soup is also used to loop through all the links and grabs the content from those pages.

## GPT2
GPT2 was used to create new speeches using Obama previous speeches.


## Improvements need
The website with the speech is older making it harder to get that content. I also go titles and some content that was not needed. 

The content has a wonky format that I could not fix. Fixing this would help with sentence structure and give it a more natural look.

## Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to scrape the web for content using python. I found this article on [How to scrape the web using python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460) to be very helpful. The article introduced me to beautiful soup a powerful python library used to scrape information off of website. [Julia-git](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460) has a detailed pyni file that helped me get started.

I was able to get all the links on the website but then I had to loop through all the links and get the content from each link. I wrote a 
code with the help of some code from [blarf_irl
](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3ha9x1/iterate_through_multiple_web_pages/). I couldn't figure out how to format the content in a good way. Gpt2 was used to create new Obama speeches using his previous ones.
