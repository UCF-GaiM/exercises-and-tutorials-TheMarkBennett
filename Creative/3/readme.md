# Creative Project 3: Synesthetic Instrument

by Mark Bennett

This work uses p5js and the ml5 libraries to allow the user to input the url of an image and see if the machine can guess whats in the image. It is using the [COCOSSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) datatsets to for object detection.

##Instructions for running the project
The project can [ viewed here](https://editor.p5js.org/TheMarkBennett/present/3LsnJackS). Find an image in the internet and copy it's url. It works best with images that end in a file extention of jpg, jpeg or png. Enter that url into the input field and submit it. It will tell you what it think it is and the percentage it think it is.

## Artist Statement

This work was inspired by the ML5 tutorial on object detection. I extended the tutorial by allowing introducting an input field where the end user could ass the url to an image and seeing if the objects in it could be dected.
