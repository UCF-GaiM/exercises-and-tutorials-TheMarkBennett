LORD PRENIN: You?
Arya falls after a tense moment. She walks away from the door, crying.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The Faith Militant have finished removing the black robes for Meera. She walks away
MELISANDRE: I am a prisoner in the Red Keep. I am free to choose my leader or my enemies' freedom. But for those who choose to follow me, the truth is, when I was taken in, I was told to beat the bitch until she screamed.
SANSA: That's the truth.
MELISANDRE: And you were told to kill her by the arrogant Queen Daenerys.
SANSA: So, when will the truth come out?
MELISANDRE: Soon.
MELISANDRE exits, and SANSA watches.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The Faith Militant has finished removing Lord Eddard's black robes.
Melisandre approaches Eddard's desk.
DAENERYS: Lord Eddard.
EDDARD: Yes, my lady?
Melisandre touches his face.
DA
====================
LORD PRENNEN: You remember the way. When I took it away, you remember the way.
LORD PRENNEN: I did.
INT: King's Landing, TYRION's chambers, night
PODRICK stands in the hallway. TYRION approaches him.
TYRION: You're a bit drunk.
PODRICK: Certainly.
TYRION:  How do you sleep at night?
PODRICK:  I don't.
TYRION:  You know.
PODRICK: I don't.
TYRION:  How do you sleep at night?
PODRICK:  I seem to remember.
TYRION: You're not a fighter.
PODRICK: That's a good thing. A very good thing.
TYRION:  I'm not a fighter.
PODRICK:  No?
TYRION: A fighter, a knightly man. I'm not a knight. I'm a Lord of Lannister and Breaker of Chains. Here you are a Knight of the Flowers.
PODRICK: You don't believe it.
TY
====================
LORD LUWIN:  I sent the Stark cloaks to investigate the brothel, hoping to catch the thieves.  I sent men from King's Landing to the slums of King's Landing.  They found no sign of Sansa or Myrcella.
The men gasp and draw their swords.  The men draw their bows.  SAM dies.
SAM attempts to get to the door of the brothel.  It is surrounded by filthy and covered in blood.  Men and women scream.  LITTLE SAM spurs the men away from the door.
SAM:  I'll find you a place to sleep, Sam.
SAM and LITTLE SAM lay their swords on the ground and cough.  Pile up whatever remains of belongings they found.
SAM:  I'll find you a place to sleep.  You know that.
SAM and LITTLE SAM stand up and walk to the door.  SAM holds a cup of wine and pours it down SAM's nose with his own wine.
SAM:  It's not good enough.
SAM and LITTLE SAM stand up.  SAM fills his cup to drink.
SAM:  You know that.
SAM stands
====================
LORD PRENDAHL: I wasn’t here to argue over a game.
MERRY MARTY: Lord Renly, I have consulted with your eldest son, Robert. He has every right to expect that respect is his first gift as Lord of Highgarden.
MELISANDRE: The first gift? He's a lord.
BRYNDEN pours water for MELISANDRE’s wounds, and then BRAN.
BRAN: Your Grace.
BRAN kneels beside him.
BRAN: I always thought you were a nice fellow.
BRAN: But you're not.
BRAN talks to a man, and the man turns to see BRAN on the steps of the throne room, with BRAN’s face covered.
BRAN: I am Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.
SANSA: How do you know that?
BRAN: I was told it was your father.
SANSA: Robert never talked about the Stark boy.
BRAN: No father, no secrets. What did Robert say about him?
SANSA:  He was a rebel.
BRAN: No idea what
====================
LORD PRENDAHL: Who?
JOHN ROYCE: Lord Greyjoy.
TYRION turns to JAIME, who stares at him in shock.
JAIME:  You're Lord Greyjoy, not my mother's maiden name. My father's last name. I'm sorry I had to leave you.
TYRION: He's a good man. He's a good man's father. I've known him long enough.
JAIME: A long journey, Lord Greyjoy. You've enjoyed it?
TYRION:  Well, I suppose I've enjoyed your company. Most of all, I swear to you.
JAIME: Yes, I swear to you.
TYRION: I think I've enjoyed it.
JAIME: What's that?
TYRION:  The Iron Islands. I've sailed to those islands, Lord Greyjoy. Heard a war-cry.
JAIME: That's a war cry.
TYRION:  Is that a war cry?
JAIME:  It's a war cry.
TYRION: (laughs) That's a lovely song.
JAIME: (CROWD) The war
