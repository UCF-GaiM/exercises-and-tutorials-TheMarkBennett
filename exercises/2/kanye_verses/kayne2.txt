The Cool Whip - Deep fried hoisin' bread
In the restaurant with my mama, she had me puffin' on her leather
If you ain't knackered up like she did, you in the club
You never listened to me then the music - the radio
The Dre beats is killer, the Kanye beats is killer
$ a night, that's a gig, you ain't get that
You probably never get that money, you just looked at crybin'
I'm a black man with a white wife, two black kids
A rap beat, I'ma call somebody else
I was sick about the beat, made a rap beat, black out
But by the way nigga, if you don't got a job
Then don't go making shit and lying
About the beat, about the beat
Black out, black out, I can't make it now
I gotta call some niggas, get my kids
Get they kids, that's the scene
I can't make it now, I gotta move
But I'm so sick about the beat, made a rap beat, black out
But by the way nigga, if you don't have a job
Then don't go making shit and lying
About the beat, about the beat
Black out, black out, I can't make it now
But I can't make it now, I gotta move
I got a black on black, I got a black on black
Cold as the wind, yeah we go
And we don't know where we gonna go
And the beat's so cold, I can't make it
But the pain's so worth it
So let's make it, and then I make it

I can't make it now, I gotta move
But I'm so glad I got you on

You know the name Kanye did, he was such a service
I was so honored to be a part of that, man
You can ask the Chicago Bulls
I got a son and he was so kind
To help me with my pain, man

I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I did Die by Daylight, man, that's good
Funny how I'm good at this?
Then forget me, be a reality
Then explain why I'm bad
You killed the day, look how I got on
Thuggin', "Damn, Axel Foley was wrong"
I'm back from the future seen
Tarantino, Lexapro, Aaliyah
Flyer, you get a girl, you go ahead and make her dance
Awesome, Henny makes a bad nigga do this
Awesome, I'm almost there, a lot of niggas did him

I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm into something, that's more than just a job
Some people do features and parcel
And he is, so much more than that
I wrote a track for the F-A-B-O
Everytime I drive by, I'm looking at how I did
Drive by and admire the view
Tarantino, Lexapro
A lot of niggas did him
Act like you ain't saying he wasn't right
I'm almost there, a lot of niggas did him
Act like you ain't saying he wasn't right
A lot of niggas do him, almost forgot him
And he is, so much more than that

I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm into something, that's more than just a job
Some people do more beats than there are teams
I played ten thousand balls, that's more than enough
Pop the F-A-B-O, pop the champagne
Pop the little suds, like the GS
Get caught up in the moment, look back at how we hooked
How we hooked, blew the game, blew the game again

This the cray-ist shit in the world, yeah you're on point
This the cray-ist shit in the world, yeah you're on point
We rapping like we don't know what we doing
Got the beats, but don't know what you're doin'
Got the clothes, but don't know what you're doin'
Yeah you're on, but you ain't love me
Only thing you got is the love, is soon as she rockin

She said, "I don't rock walls"
If a nigga tell you the truth
That's why my name got hype
The reason I got so many names, only known for
What you see is what you get
Word got me, I couldn't get my ideas out
Out of the corner of your eye
Cause I can't see the O's, the screen was messed up

Uh, snapped when I don't see shit
