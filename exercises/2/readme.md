# EXERCISE 2: Creating Specific Output from GPT-2

This project uses GPT-2 to create two different models. One for a game of thrones script and the other for a Kanye Song.

# Game of Thrones
I used a [Game of thrones](https://github.com/shekharkoirala/Game_of_Thrones) script datasest that includes all 8 seasons of the show. From that I ran it through GPT-2 on colab and created two new scripts. 
# Kayne
Kayne is in the building. I used a [Kanye West Rap Verses](https://www.kaggle.com/viccalexander/kanyewestverses) dataset that includes 243 Songs and 364 Verses. I used GPT-2 to create a new song from these Kayne verses. **Note:** The ouput of these new song to contain explict lyrics.
