# EXERCISE 5: Create a text grammar or interactive bot

By Sthephany Maldonado, Hanae Hmimid and Mark Bennett

We chose the theme of Donload Trump mean tweets

## Hanae

This Tracery text grammar aims in a playful way to bring forward the funny/offensive side of Trump’s famous tweet: “North Korean Kim Jong Un stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my button”. We proceeded by adding new adjectives, places, countries, sizes, and characters to the generated sentences.
