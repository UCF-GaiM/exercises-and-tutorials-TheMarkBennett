## Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator is a tool to calculate the percentage of a tip from the overall cost of a bill. We tried to make a useful bot in that regard that would allow customers to calculate the percentage of the cost of the bill.

## Day of the Week

In the second intent, we thought of a way to ask a bot which day of the week a date lands on. An example of a question could be what day falls on 10/02/2020? The bot would respond with “Friday”. It’s an easy direct way to convert dates to weekdays.

## Check Split

For the Splitcheck we created two slots to get us the correct amount when splitting the total amount of a check. The two slots were CheckCost and NumberofPeople. At the beginning we faced some misspelling issues but we make it worked.
